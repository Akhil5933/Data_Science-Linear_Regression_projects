# Linear_Regression_project
# Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target variable) and one or more independent variables (predictor variables). The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting linear relationship that describes the data.
# Here we are considering income dataset for the linear_regression_model, we can choose any other type of dataset we want.
# Simple Linear Regression model can be represented as: y=mx+c
# y is the dependent variable, 
# x is the independent variable,
# â€‹c is the intercept, 
# m is the coefficient for the independent variable.
# The model is trained using a dataset with known values of both the independent and dependent variables.
# Common evaluation metrics for Linear Regression include Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (Coefficient of Determination), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
